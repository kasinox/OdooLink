# OdooLink

-Odoo hosted on Amazonaws for CRM</br>

-Issue with slow Odoo hosted on a server across the pacific ocean, the latency is making the system virtually unusable on state side.</br>


-Two part to OdooLink</br>
-OdooLink alltekusa part is hosted Locally</br>
-OdooLink OdooLinke part is hosted on Amazonaws server</br>


-Directly Reading data from Odoo's database and display sales order information via Tomcat</br>
-Reading data from webpage -> and insert sales order into quickbooks to reduce latency</br>
-Requires adding additional fields into quickbooks</br>
-additional fields seems to be slowing down quickbooks</br>
